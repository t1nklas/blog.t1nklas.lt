I've been obsessing over music in general this year, I used to listen to it just for the background, but now I **listen** to it.\n\n## What do you listen to?\n\nLast week as I am writing this, I got asked \"Why do you listen to such unknown artists?\". Which is obvious in my opinion, most* people like what's popular, and there are MANY amazing small artists that do music as a hobby. And why not support them? I've switched to Tidal (from Spotify) mainly for higher payout for others (~1 cent per stream) and FLAC. Not to mention it's also partially cheaper than Spotify right now, which is great.\nYeah, I may not listen to the most \"unknown\" artists, but mostly everyone I know doesnt know about them, so here is my short list :3\n\nVoX LoW -- Superkoloritas -- Soft Kill -- Andy Stott -- BEATFOOT (BEATFOOT ALBUM)",
